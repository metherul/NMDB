If I bite your head off, It&#39;s due to stress.

[color=yellow]9/10[/color] times, it is not the mod. It is the showracemenu in general. Skyrim is designed to load everything at once while in character creation. So if you have say...hair mods. It will likely crash if your PC can not handle the output. So below is the recommended fix. Matera IS compatible with all hair mods. I have over 275+ hairs and I have yet to see any NOT compatible. \r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33526/?] ShowRaceMenu Precache Killer by kapaer[/url]\r<br />[line]\r<br />[center] I have placed a new requests section at the bottom of the page.

Something may also not be enabled(checked).\r<br />\r<br />First, make sure you have Race Compatibility by TMPheonix (NOT the older one&#33;). This IS required because the werewolf and the vampire won&#39;t work without it&#33;\r<br />Second, make sure that your Skyrim is updated to the latest version. As of writing this it is v1.8.1.\r<br />Third, Double check and MAKE sure the racecompatibility.esm AND Matera/BMatera is checked&#33; (I know, I know, noob mistake but it CAN HAPPEN)\r<br />Forth, Make sure you have the Main file installed THEN your body file (if done manually)(this won&#39;t usually cause it to not show up but its best to check)\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />[color=yellow][b]My Game crashes when changing from male to female or changing race in general.[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Answer: My first suggestion would be to check and make sure you have the correct body type (if you use an armor/clothing replacement) as well as the racial compatibility mod.\r<br />\r<br />[s]My HIGHEST suggestion would be to use the sex change work around mod below.

Have a great day.\r<br />\r<br />Ok, people still keep missing this.....Here&#39;s the easy Instructions...My morning sickness leaves me in no mood to talk.\r<br />1)Install Main File\r<br />2)Install Racial Compatibility mod (YES IT IS REQUIRED&#33; QUIT ASKING&#33;) and updated&#33;\r<br />3)Install Body Compatibility (You obviously want the body installed as well. Cause some bodies wig out without the proper armor replacements.)\r<br />4)Skyrim NEEDS (and when I mean needs, I don&#39;t mean if you feel like it) to be UP TO DATE&#33;\r<br />5)Check and MAKE SURE that everything is activated&#33; Yes&#33; this does happen.\r<br />\r<br />I am also not responsible for another race mod that does not use RC&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Also give me specifics&#33; Which Matera race mod (many call each one Matera)? In what order did you install? Did you install RC? Is your Skyrim up to date? Did you CHECK to make sure everything was activated?

It was the Brawl Bugs Patch itself. As soon as I uninstalled it, brawls began functioning correctly. If I had to guess, it&#39;s because I am using SPERG, which seems to have some sort of brawling fix already. \r<br /> ==============================================================================================================================\r<br />For the latest in preview images and announcements to upcoming patches and updates please click on the picture below:\r<br />[url=http://charismoon.tumblr.com/][img]http://i60.tinypic.com/2md0yuf.jpg[/img]\r<br />[/url]",
