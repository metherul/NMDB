A simple chest with all the stuff.\r<br />I had in mind to update to a better location first, but i won&#39;t find the time anymore.\r<br />The stuff is mostly NOT additionally craftable, and the inventar-models do not fit. I don&#39;t care tho, important for me were only the ingame-outfits. Use them as they are, there won&#39;t be any upgrade. But it works nicely imo.\r<br />Btw., the original Litheria outfits in the Temple will mostly have clipping on the BBP-body, due to reshape of wider hips, jiggling breasts and reshaped thighs. But few original outfit-parts are still usable on this new body.\r<br />\r<br />The BBP-outfit-parts are named by their [i]used bodyslots[/i] and thus [i]sorted by numbers[/i]:\r<br />31 for headwear\r<br />37 for footwear\r<br />46 for piercings\r<br />49 for nails\r<br />50 for corsages\r<br />55 for upperbody\r<br />etc. ..\r<br />[/color]\r<br />[/b][/color]\r<br />[img]http://www.ld-host.de/uploads/images/464f4982d45463a3bed8c05a0d6436df.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />The mod is separated into two parts:\r<br />\r<br />The *Litheria* Race & Body\r<br />--------------------------\r<br />When using this mod, your female game-character will be different from all other characters in Skyrim;\r<br />She will have a unique body-shape, and unique skin, glowing eyes, pointed teeth, real finger- & toenails, and own unique abilities.\r<br />She&#39;ll be the only girl in Skyrim with that superslender figure, to wear the armors, outfits and accessories you can obtain in the Temple of Litheria. And she will also be slim as werewolf ;)\r<br />Litherias have a bonus on sneaking and silent moving, thus they are perfect nighthunters & assassins. \r<br />But: There is only ONE bodyshape - no weightslider. Why? Read the FAQs.\r<br />The mod is Dawnguard-compatible, tho the Dawngurd-DLC is not required&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The *Temple of Litheria* - a storage with armors (VERS. 2.0)\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />Inside you will find some chests, filled with armors and outfits, all in parts, for mix and match, also a few mannequins to throw some of the stuff on them. \r<br />Go and find your favourite ... or maybe go naked, your choice ;)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />IMPORTANT: \r<br />The body itself is exactly as i want it, and i&#39;m NOT interested in opinions or critics.\r<br />I&#39;m aware, that this is not everyone&#39;s cup of tea, and i&#39;m ok with that.\r<br />So, If you do not like the body or the body-shape, then please leave without a comment.\r<br />This stated, i will report every kinda trolling, flaming or inappropriate remark.\r<br />(HN66)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://www.ld-host.de/uploads/images/1d141a856c62e3e0ce3072e803d986c7.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />A check of your map, after your escape from Helgen, will show you the location of the Temple of Litheria, north and not that far from you.\r<br />It is marked as Dwemer-Ruin, and show up on your HUD as far as you are out of Helgen.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://www.ld-host.de/uploads/images/059356c8305ce7766ab84fcf25f43c93.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />I recommend to install manually, don&#39;t use NMM.\r<br />Well, you only need the ability of copy & paste :)\r<br />\r<br />It is important to use EXACTLY the same folder-structures as they are given in the mod-packs&#33;\r<br />Any little mistake in paths or a misspelled foldernames will result in a non-working mod&#33;\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: If a required folder already exists, copy the new contents into it.\r<br />If a required folder does not exist, you need to create it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />1.\r<br />Unzip and extract the &#34;LitheriaRaceAndBodyPack111&#34; to any temporary folder.\r<br />\r<br />2.\r<br />Copy the contents into the designated folders, exactly the way you find them given in the mod-pack.\r<br />\r<br />3.\r<br />Then unzip and extract the &#34;LitheriaArmorPack_20&#34; to any temporary folder.\r<br />\r<br />4.\r<br />Copy the contents into the designated folders, exactly the way you find them given in the mod-pack.\r<br />\r<br />5.\r<br />Activate both esps in your launcher.\r<br />\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://www.ld-host.de/uploads/images/cd9f7e251ba376ee93304cffb749e426.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Delete all files, associated with the mod.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://www.ld-host.de/uploads/images/b4a5547ed8bc3ad0fb40cf328978e526.jpg[/img]\r<br />none that i know of;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://www.ld-host.de/uploads/images/06aa3d760da52006eda57aff7df4f023.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[i]Q: Why does this body-mod inlcude only one bodyshape?[/i]\r<br />A: That is due to four reasons.\r<br />First, by now there are several bodyreplacers in the nexus, all more or less similar, with bodyshapes from normal to big, so i saw no reason to make another one.\r<br />Besides, the intention never was to make an all-around-body-replacer, but a custom-race-body.\r<br />Second, the &#39;heavy&#39; body would get a pretty &#39;bulky&#39; shoulder-neck-part, to make it fit to the bigger neck-seam, when u set the slider on heavy. On that (still being slender) body it looks absurd. So, slider on &#39;light&#39; and everything&#39;s fine. .. at least to my taste :)\r<br />Third, originally this was never ment to be released at all, and so i made only one bodyshape - to my own liking.\r<br />When i decided to eventually release it, due to some requests, some of the armors were already completed.\r<br />Fourth and finally, making outfits for two body-shapes means ~50 percent more work, and as it&#39;s likely that i will be the only one doing outfits for the Litheria ... well, enough work for me anyway ;)\r<br />So, the Litheria comes in one shape only - lithe and superslender, the try to build a model-like body.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Q: Is the Litheria-body compatible with any other body?[/i]\r<br />A: Superslim as it is, the connections of hands & feet might not match that perfectly to other bodies, but that belongs to the respective Bodymodel. The weightslider needs to be set to &#34;light&#34; in any case.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Q: Is it possible to wear other armors than those i can find in the Temple?[/i]\r<br />A: Litheria-babes can wear most of Skyrim&#39;s standard-armors, and many of the Outfits created by other modders, especially those made for UNP, as the texture-layout is very similar.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Q: Does that also mean i can use the skin of any other body-model maybe?[/i]\r<br />A: As the Litheria-body is made from the original game-bodymesh, like most body-replacers, other body-textures might almost fit. Important is, that the texture-layout is close to the vanilla-body.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Q: The mannequins are very dull & unreflective.[/i]\r<br />A: That gets fixed as soon as u put any item into their inventory.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Q: The mannequins don&#39;t wear vanilla-items or any other mod&#39;s item ?&#33;[/i]\r<br />A: Those babes can only wear those items, which are assigned to their race.\r<br />Thus they wear only Litheria-items.\r<br />If u want them to also wear any non-Litheria-items, then those need to be assigned in the armor-mod&#39;s esp. \r<br />Don&#39;t ask me, you gotta do that urself.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Q: How can i get more numbers of the armor-parts?&#33;[/i]\r<br />A: A procedure to multiply the temple&#39;s items:\r<br />1. look for any aside standing chest and put the part, which u wanna multiply, into it.\r<br />2. open the console (hit the ^-key), and click on the chest.\r<br />3. now type INV , which will show you whatz inside the chest, and voila - u will find the item and it&#39;s code.\r<br />4. now type  ADDITEM xxxxxxxxxxx 3  (where that xxxxxxxxx is that item-code, and 3 will be the number of copies u will get), and hit enter.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://www.ld-host.de/uploads/images/1db0ecb0eb88b1d097c8105437023ed8.jpg[/img]\r<br />Some armorparts could clip, if you use them simultaniously, but you&#39;ll surely find out which fit together well.\r<br />Besides that, both mods are tested on different rigs, and showed NO problem at all.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Recommendations:\r<br />================\r<br />If you wanna be a vampire, we recommend the use of the &#34;Better Vampires&#34;-mod.\r<br />(http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9717)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://www.ld-host.de/uploads/images/3f19c3d8a29478702cab8fa3955f5ada.jpg[/img]\r<br />You can find us on the Nexus as Humannature66 and Ginnyfizz.\r<br />if u need technical help with this, use the thread or contact us via pm;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://www.ld-host.de/uploads/images/9b555c9e239ecf0d03b42869f12c9a3f.jpg[/img]\r<br />Credits & Thanx\r<br />===============\r<br />Maevan2 for &#34;Mature skin texture and body for UNP(B) 7BASE CBBE Vanilla&#34;\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32986/?\r<br />(-THX for your permission to use your skins on Litheria&#33;-)\r<br />\r<br />xp32 for *XP32 Maximum Skeleton - XPMS*\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26800/?\r<br />(- thx 4 ur work, man, cos we all need bounce  :D   )\r<br />\r<br />Tigersan for &#34;Female Muscle Mod&#34; (Normal-Map)\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/44\r<br />(-thx for ur permission, without ur NormalMaps i would have not released anything&#33;-)\r<br />\r<br />SvarogNL for &#34;Fitness Body&#34; (Normal-Map &gt; Abs)\r<br />(http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16731/?)\r<br />(-thx for ur permission to use those sexy abs&#33;-)\r<br />\r<br />Phygit for &#34;FemFeet&#34; (feetmeshes)\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3666\r<br />(-thx for ur permission to use those nicely detailed feet&#33;-)\r<br />\r<br />BellaGail for &#34;Better Females by Bella&#34; (face-tex & parts of face-N-Map)\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812\r<br />(-my favourite face-tex from the beginning&#33;-)\r<br />\r<br />Eronel55 for &#34;E55 Female Body Replacer&#34; (parts of hand-N-Map)\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12694\r<br />(-for resources, valuable technical advice, support and friendship.-)\r<br />\r<br />Jen, 2pac4eva7 & XunAmarox for &#34;Blender NIF Import - Export Tutorial&#34;.\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3790\r<br />(-one of the most important tuts for meshing of course&#33;-)\r<br />\r<br />Néostralie for permission to use his awesome Chainmail-texture&#33;\r<br />Check his blog *Space-Coyote-Of-Ze-Moon*\r<br />http://space-coyote-of-ze-moon.over-blog.com\r<br />\r<br />RazorX13 for being a friend.\r<br />   \r<br />bhaktisean for help, support & testing the race-mod.\r<br />\r<br />d_rail1602 for inspiration and support on custom races.\r<br />\r<br />theRoadstroker for some friendly advice on the description.\r<br />\r<br />Ghogiel for being helpfull with nifskope.\r<br />\r<br />fallout3nexus987 for a [i]very[/i] helpfull hint about Nifskope, thx bro.\r<br />\r<br />Tattoedillusion and LadyMilla for support and encouragement.\r<br />\r<br />Bethesda for creating Skyrim;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Thanx for the mods used on the screenshots:\r<br />===========================================\r<br />*1HD Weapons on Back TS Edition* by TS\r<br />*Better Females by Bella* by BellaGail\r<br />*Female Muscle Mod* by Tigersan\r<br />*Sporty Sexy Sweat* by Xs2reality\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />We hope we have not forgotten anyone here.
