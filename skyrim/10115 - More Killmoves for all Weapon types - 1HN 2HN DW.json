Furthermore, the [color=orange]Backstab[/color] and [color=orange]Sneak Attack[/color] moves are now available for all weapons.\r\n*Normal Killmoves means killmoves that don\\'t require strict conditions like perks or being in sneak.\r\n*Bleedout is when the enemy has very low health and is laying/kneeling on the ground at your mercy\r\n\r\n>[color=aqua]Patch 1.5 Killmoves[/color]: [color=orange][i]14 Normal Killmoves[/i][/color] added (2 are unarmed and 2 are for warhammers/battleaxes only and weren\\'t added to the other weapons), [color=orange]2 Sneak Attacks[/color] and [color=orange]3 Backstab Attacks[/color].\r\n\r\n[color=aqua][size=3]Added Killmoves for each weapon[/size][/color]\r\n[color=green1]1HN Sword/Dagger [/color] - [color=gold]Total: 39 Killmoves[/color] - 27 Normal Killmoves, 3 Decaps, 2 Decap Bleedouts, 1 Bleedout, 3 Backstabs, 3 Sneak Attacks. \r\nAdded 2HN stab, 2 Killmoves from 1HN mace/axe, made all 1HN rare killmoves more frequent, 2 Decaps from DW and 2HN, 2HN Bleedout Decap.\r\n[color=green1]1HN Mace/Waraxe[/color] - [color=gold]Total: 39 Killmoves[/color] - 27 Normal Killmoves, 3 Decaps, 2 Decap Bleedouts, 1 Bleedout, 3 Backstabs, 3 Sneak Attacks. \r\nAdded all 1HN killmoves and 2HN stab, 2 Decaps from DW and 2HN, 2HN and 1HN sword Bleedout Decaps, 1HN sword Bleedout Killing Blow, Backstab, 1HN Sneak Attack and 1HN Sneak Decap.\r\n[color=green1]2HN Greatsword[/color] - [color=gold]Total: 39 Killmoves[/color] - 27 Normal Killmoves, 3 Decaps, 2 Decap Bleedouts, 1 Bleedout, 3 Backstabs, 3 Sneak Attacks. \r\nAdded all 1HN killmoves, 2 Decaps from DW and 1HN, 2HN and 1HN sword Bleedout Decaps, 1HN sword Bleedout Killing Blow, Backstab, 1HN Sneak Attack and 1HN Sneak Decap.\r\n[color=green1]2HN Battleaxe/Warhammer[/color] - [color=gold]Total: 45 Killmoves[/color] - 30 Normal Killmoves, 4 Decaps, 3 Decap Bleedouts, 1 Bleedout, 4 Backstabs, 3 Sneak Attacks. \r\nAdded all 1HN killmoves, 2 Decaps from DW and 1HN, 2HN and 1HN sword Bleedout Decaps, 1HN sword Bleedout Killing Blow, Backstab, 1HN Sneak Attack and 1HN Sneak Decap.\r\n[color=green1]DW[/color] - [color=gold]Total: 39 Killmoves[/color] - 27 Normal Killmoves, 3 Decaps, 2 Decap Bleedouts, 1 Bleedout, 3 Backstabs, 3 Sneak Attacks. \r\nAdded all 1HN killmoves, 2 Decaps from 2HN and 1HN, 1HN and 2HN Bleedout Decaps, 1HN sword Bleedout Killing Blow, Backstab, 1HN Sneak Attack and 1HN Sneak Decap.\r\n\r\nThere is an [color=orange]extra Sneak move[/color] that decapitates the enemy [i](it is essentially the 1HN Decap but performed while sneaking and from behind)[/i]. For those who want to get a killmove even with enemies in close vicinity there are options available (see Versions).\r\n\r\nPerforming decapitation moves still requires either the perks \\'Savage Strike\\' or \\'Devastating Blow\\'. With the extra added decapitation moves to each weapon type you do not need to have both perks. For example, performing a 2HN decap with a 1HN sword will require \\'Savage Strike\\' and not \\'Devastating Blow\\'  because a 1HN weapon is used. This applies also for the 2HN weapons requiring the \\'Devastating Blow\\' perk for performing all the 3 Decap moves that have been added.\r\n\r\nThe only killmoves not used are the ones for warhammer as it seems that other weapon types are unable to use these killmoves, not sure why even the patch 1.5 killmoves.\r\n\r\n[color=aqua][size=5]Video[/size][/color]\r\nI have made a compilation video for all the new animations added to all the weapon types in the game. Well originally it started out as a compilation then I playing around with the video to make it more like a movie, then things got a bit weird and eventually it came out like this.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the video but not too much:\r\n[youtube]F9nZDyAn8Y8[/youtube]\r\n[b]Skyrim - A day out with Nazeem[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[youtube]b35EBifFf80[/youtube]\r\nThis is a video demonstration made by pinto123412341234 for this mod\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=aqua][size=5]All Killmoves in the game[/size][/color]\r\nOf the [color=orange]18 Normal Killmoves[/color], 6 are from 1HN sword, 9 are also from 1HN sword but were rarely seen, 2 are from 1HN axe/mace and a 2HN stab from 2HN greatsword/battleaxe. \r\n[color=orange]3 Decap Killmoves[/color] - 1 from 1HN weapons, 1 from 2HN greatsword/battleaxe and 1 from Dual weapons\r\n[color=orange]2 Bleedout Decap Killmoves[/color] – 1 from 1HN weapons and 1 from 2HN greatsword/battleaxe\r\n[color=orange]1 Bleedout Killmove[/color] - from 1HN sword\r\nSome of the moves are problematic, for example, dodgy cameras, prematurely and annoyingly stopping and then you have to watch your character stand like an idiot whilst your mashing the keyboard and screaming at the screen TO MOVE!! This is the reason why I made 1HMKillMoveJ (see below) more rare than the others. I might remove it entirely actually I better do that.\r\n\r\n[color=aqua][size=5]Mod Details[/size][/color]\r\nThe mod now with update 5 has a menu system for installation.\r\nBelow I have detailed varies bits of the mod including the optionals.\r\n\r\n[color=gold]Essential[/color]\r\n>The main aspect of the mod is all the killmoves added, see section \\'Added Killmoves for each weapon\\' for more information, which are installed regardless of the options chosen. At the moment no killmoves can be added or removed. \r\n>All killmoves are added to the normal and power attacks of the right hand and some have been added so that they can be triggered by the left hand.\r\n\r\n[color=gold]General options[/color]\r\n[color=orange]Last enemy limit removed[/color] -  with this you can perform killmoves even with multiple enemies in the vicinity.\r\n[color=orange]Player cannot be killmoved[/color] - with this player cannot be killmoved by other enemies.\r\n\r\n[color=gold]Killcam options[/color]\r\n[color=orange]1st Person only - 1st person only killcam[/color] - Kill moves are always performed in 1st Person when in 1st Person view. Killmoves performed in 3rd person will, however, always be performed in 3rd person.\r\n[color=orange]No 3rd Person killcam (including no blur effects)[/color] - When killmove is performed it is viewed above and behind the player. This is for 3rd person only i.e. killmoves in 1st person are performed in 1st person.\r\n[color=orange]No 3rd person killcam - 3rd Person only (including no blur effects)[/color] - No 3rd Person killcam including no blur effects. When killmove is performed it is viewed above and behind the player. In this version killmoves are performed in 3rd person regardless of whether you are in 1st person or already in 3rd person.\r\n\r\n[color=gold]1st Person Killcam slow motion options[/color]\r\n[color=orange]Slow motion normal version[/color] - This file adds a slow motion effect in the 1st Person killcam that is often seen in 3rd Person killcams. Slow motion effect occurs when you first hit the enemy with your weapon and lasts for few seconds before going back to normal time. In this version slow motion effect is half of normal time.\r\n[color=orange]Slow motion slower version[/color] - This file adds a slow motion effect in the 1st Person killcam that is often seen in 3rd Person killcams. Slow motion effect occurs when you first hit the enemy with your weapon and lasts for few seconds before going back to normal time. Slower version is 0.3 of normal time.\r\n\r\n[color=aqua][size=4]Other mods[/size][/color]\r\nI also have a unarmed kill mod, [size=3][color=aqua][url=file.php?id=8094]Extra Unarmed Kill Animations[/url][/color][/size], that adds the 1HN and 2HN killmoves to unarmed.\r\n\r\n[size=3][color=aqua][url=file.php?id=12502]Wabbajack Unleashed - More effects[/url][/size][/color]. This mod gives the wabbajack more crazy effects check it out and the videos.\r\n\r\n[color=aqua][size=5]Killmove descriptions[/size][/color]\r\nBelow I have given the technical name of the killmove animations used in the game and the description of move itself:\r\n[color=LawnGreen]1HMKillMoveD[/color] - jumping stab\r\n[color=LawnGreen]1HMKillMoveE[/color] - shield hit and stab (triggered only if shield in left hand for 1HN weapons, for 2HN weapons this condition is obviously removed)\r\n[color=LawnGreen]KillMoveShortD[/color] - shoulder stab\r\n[color=LawnGreen]1HMKillMoveI[/color] - stab twirl then slash\r\n[color=LawnGreen]1HMKillMoveJ[/color] - closeline and stamp (this move is really buggy so I have made it more rare than the others)\r\n[color=LawnGreen]KillMoveShortB[/color] – 1 handed stab through chest\r\n[color=LawnGreen]1HMKillMoveA_NoShield1HN[/color] - kick and stab\r\n[color=LawnGreen]1HMKillMoveB[/color] - hit trip slash\r\n[color=LawnGreen]1HMKillMoveC[/color] - punch flip stab\r\n[color=LawnGreen]1HMKillMoveF[/color] - push slash\r\n[color=LawnGreen]1HMKillMoveG[/color] - swings weapon then slashs\r\n[color=LawnGreen]1HMKillMoveH[/color] - triple slash\r\n[color=LawnGreen]1HMKillMoveK[/color] - twirl slash\r\n[color=LawnGreen]1HMKillMoveL[/color] - overhand slash\r\n[color=LawnGreen]1HMKillMoveM[/color] - punch throw slash\r\n[color=LawnGreen]KillMoveShortC[/color] - quick overhand slash\r\n[color=LawnGreen]KillMoveShortA[/color] - quick diagonal slash\r\n[color=LawnGreen]KillMove2HMstab[/color] - 2 handed stab through chest\r\nNote: descriptions aren’t endorsed by Bethesda Softworks\r\n\r\n[color=aqua][size=5]Key[/size][/color]\r\n1HN - 1 handed\r\n2HN - 2 handed\r\nDW - Dual Wield\r\n\r\n[color=aqua][size=5]Installation[/size][/color]\r\nUsing Nexus Mod Manager - a new menu system has been added in update 5 of this mod which enables a much easier way to install this mod along with certain optionals. See \\'Mod Details\\' section for more information on the options.\r\nNot using Nexus Mod Manager - I would strongly recommend using Nexus Mod Manager as there are a lot of files in the version 5 archive. Files are named to give their general role on what they do and you can simply extract then and insert them into the Data folder of the Skyrim directory. Delete to uninstall. Its not that hard\r\n\r\nIf you have any problems with this mod or my soul then please feel free to leave comments and also endorse this mod.",
