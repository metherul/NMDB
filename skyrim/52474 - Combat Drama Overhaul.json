What does this mean?  It means that your killmoves will feel more fresh and varied as they will have new camera shots and timing added to them.  The animations won&#39;t change, just how I show them off.  IT.  IS.  AWESOME.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=5][color=pink]I&#39;M READY FOR MY CLOSE-UP, MR. DEVILLE[/color][/size][/b]\r<br />I now have somewhat-total control of all camera angles, so that means I can now create new killcam shots for regular and ranged killmoves.  I have created a variety of entirely new killcams for you to enjoy, and I&#39;ve also expanded vanilla ranged killmoves for greater variety.  I also opened up normal camera angles for sabrecat and bear non-ranged killmoves(because they annoyed me).  I have also restored killcams for firestorm and other cast on player area of effect spells.  \r<br />\r<br />[b][size=5][color=pink]MAKE IT STOP[/color][/size][/b]\r<br />Vanilla camera pathing can leave you staring inexplicably at your leg or a patch of dirt for a long time.  CDO adds new parameters in so that a) you&#39;re less likely to stare at dirt and b) all camera paths have been dramatically reduced in length.  Non-kill ranged killmoves(the terminology is stupid, I know, but DANGIT ONE THING AT A TIME) are significantly faster than their &#34;kill&#34; killmove counterparts(see?  confusing?  I HATE MY LIFE.  MAKE IT STOP.  MAKE DANE COOK STOP)\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://assets.diylol.com/hfs/fec/e79/a9c/resized/vengeance-dad-meme-generator-they-liked-dane-cook-they-had-to-die-5969e1.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=5][color=pink]VARIETY IS THE SPICE OF LIFE.  SO ARE DRUGS.[/color][/size][/b]\r<br />As always, the main goal of my mods is to make it so no two things are ever alike.  While this is not achieved yet, camera shots for ranged killmoves, especially for dragons, have been dramatically increased in variability.  New versions will expand this even further.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=5][color=pink]MCMS EVERYWHERE[/color][/size][/b]\r<br />Like every mod in my EGO series, this mod comes equipped with a MCM menu that you can tweak and adjust to your heart&#39;s desire.  Don&#39;t like ranged killmoves?  Turn &#39;em off.  LOVE THEM?&#33;?&#33;?&#33;?  ONE HUNDRED PERCENT, BABY&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;  Whew, I wore myself out there.  The MCM does other cool stuff too.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=5]I STILL DON&#39;T UNDERSTAND - WHAT IS THIS AND WHAT DOES IT DO?[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />This mod does 4 things: \r<br />#1 It unlocks the ability to do ranged killmoves without actually killing the target \r<br />#2 It gives you control over how often ranged killmoves play \r<br />#3 It adds new ranged killmoves and makes vanilla ranged killmoves more fluid \r<br />#4 It expands camera angle variation for non-ranged killmoves.\r<br />\r<br />Think of it this way - a non-ranged killmove in Skyrim is simply an animation, the actual killmove you see is an animation PLUS camera angles to show off the effect.  A ranged killmove on the other hand has no new animation, it simply adds new camera angles to the normal animation.  What CDO does is play with those camera angles and expands their variety greatly while making the entire killmove process feel more fluid and more conditionalized so you get the best dramatic experience.  For example, all vanilla camera angles simply take a camera shot from a single perspective for the entire duration of the killmove.  My new camera paths combine multiple perspectives, for example, one added killmove pans around the player as the player fires, then follows the projectile to its target, stops in mid air and spins around the target just prior to landing, and then following the target once it has been hit.  CDO allows me to make killmoves feel fresh and varied without having to go through the process of creating new animations - instead I use vanilla animations and repurpose them to fully utilize all the cool tricks bethesda gave themselves but didn&#39;t use.  *le sigh* so much power....wasted.\r<br />\r<br />I hope that kind of explained it to you.  As I said before, the only way to really understand what it does is to just sit down and use it and get a feel for it.  The default values should be good enough to make your combat feel overall more dramatic.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=5]KNOWN ISSUES AND INCOMPATIBILITIES[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Please visit [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52487/?]the EGO bug tracker[/url] for a list of all known issues and incompatibilities associated with this mod.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=5]FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Your description sucks.&#34;\r<br />Write your own mods and you can make whatever descriptions you want.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Seriously, your description sucks.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]VuGiK-X9-0A[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />&#34;I don&#39;t understand, why would anybody want this?&#34;\r<br />I don&#39;t understand why anybody would NOT want this.  This makes non-ranged killmoves better.  With ranged killmoves, if you like killcams, this lets you have as many of them as you want, lets you control when and how they play, and they&#39;re better than vanilla.  If you don&#39;t like killcams, you can use this mod to reduce how often they play or turn them off entirely.  This mod entails almost no CPU usage/script lag, is compatible with everything, and won&#39;t break your game(as far as I know).  \r<br />\r<br />&#34;So wait, you&#39;re saying that Dance of Death and CDO are similar, why not just have DoD and are they compatible?&#34;\r<br />Think of it this way, DoD and CDO operate on opposite sides of the same coin.  DoD concerns itself with mainly the animations that you can use, and how often the non-ranged killmoves play.  CDO affects camera paths and ranged killmoves - this means that I can still edit the other half of killmoves(the camera paths) without running afoul of DoD.  On that note, compatibility should not be an issue.  I do vaguely remember that DoD edits one or two camera paths, but from initial testing it doesn&#39;t look like a problem.  Regardless, let CDO overwrite DoD if you&#39;re having problems.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Ok, but what about Violens?  I heard it was incompatible with CDO.&#34;\r<br />As of now, CDO and Violens are compatible, you just need to download the compatibility scripts from the Violens page.  You still will want this on top of Violens so you have increased control over your ranged killmoves and so you get the benefit of the added camera angles.  However, if you just want Ranged killmoves to stop entirely, I recommend you just use Violens, it has that functionality already built into it, so the addition of CDO would be unnecessary.  Unless you really want the new camera angles for non-ranged killmoves, but I don&#39;t feel that there are enough of them yet to justify the additional esp.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=5]REVIEWS[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]yOgg36fJ84Q[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=5]HIGHLY RECOMMENDED MODS[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />These mods carry my highest recommendation.
