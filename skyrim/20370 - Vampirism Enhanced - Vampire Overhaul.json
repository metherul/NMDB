For example making being a vampire feel like you are a nocturnal creature, with buffs and bonuses at Night, and disadvantages and maybe even death if you get caught out in the sun. \r\n\r\n[Color=Red][size=4]Detail:[/size][/color]\r\n[Color=Red]--------------------[/color]\r\nChanges that this mod makes to the vampires:\r\n1. Grants the ability to freeze your openents solid with a brand new shout\r\n2. Makes the powers feel more like actual abilities, by removing the once per day restrictions on all abilities\r\n3. Makes the vampiric drain spell more powerful, to make it a viable option\r\n4. As an undead creature, you have no need for air, hence can stay underwater without fear of drowning\r\n5. No longer will you get affected by the sun unless the suns rays are touching you\r\n6. When you feed, you drain a portion of your victims health\r\n7. Removes the Attack On Sight at vampire rank 4\r\n8. Makes the sunlight \\\"damage\\\" actually feel derogetry, and more powerful vampires can be killed by the sunlight\r\n9. Added in 2 new potions - Vampirism Cure and Vampires Blood, the cure will cure vampirism, and the blood will infect you.\r\nTo Obtain the Cure, open the console by clicking the button to the left of 1 (`). and type HELP CURE or Vampirism, then scroll (using page up/down keys) until you see something like ALCH (ID) \\'Vampirism Cure\\' where ID is the ID of the Cure. Then type player.additem ID 1, where again the ID is the ID of the cure, you can replace 1 with the number of cures you would like.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the blood is the same, but instead of typing HELP cure etc., you would type HELP Blood or Vampires and scroll up till you see something like ALCH (ID) \\'Vampires Blood\\'.\r\n(Versions 3.0D and higher support this)\r\n10.Fixes the bug where as a vampire lord, your drain health spell is weaker when Serana is your follower.\r\n11.Adds in a new ability which gives you quite powerful buffs to your Health, Stamina and Magicka regen rates and gives you a Resistance to Damage during the Night (7:00pm to 6:00 am)\r\n12. Makes Vampires Seduction affect higher level enemies.\r\n13. As of 3.31 Summon Arvak is now a lesser power (while not actually a vampire related change, just thought I would put that in here anyway - if you want it removed, just say and if enough people want it out then I shall make it a separate mod.)\r\n14. Increases weakness to fire back up to to pre-dawnguard values, so Rank 4 Vampire has a 100% weakness to fire\r\n15. Adds in new effect to potion of blood - if you drink it when you are not a vampire you loose 95 points of health.\r\n\r\nFrom 3.41 onwards I have made it possible for you to decide on the damage percentages for feeding at the different ranks.\r\nTo do so, open the console (by pressing the ` button) and typing SET VT_FeedDamage# TO ###\r\n\r\nReplacing the first # with the vampire rank you want to affect, and the 2nd lot with 3 ### to the percentage. so for example if you wanted to set vampire rank 1 to kill anyone you feed on you would type SET VT_FeedDamage1 TO 100 into the console and click Enter.\r\n\r\nThe default values are:\r\nrank 1 - 25\r\nrank 2 - 40\r\nrank 3 - 55\r\nrank 4 - 70\r\n\r\nTo find the current values of damage percentages open the console (press the `) and type HELP \\\"VT_\\\", without the speech marks and you will see the 4 values.\r\n[Color=Red][size=4]---Installation:---[/size][/color]\r\n[Color=Red]--------------------------------[/color]\r\n[Color=Red][size=3]Manual Installation:[/size][/color]\r\n[Color=Red]---------------------------------[/color]\r\nTo install this mod via a manual installation you must Extract the contents of the archive and then place the contents in your Skyrim/Data folder.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT:\r\nMake sure you make a backup of any scripts that it asks you to override incase you want to uninstall this mod at a later date.\r\n\r\n[Color=Red]--------------------------------[/color]\r\n[Color=Red][size=3]NMM Installation:[/size][/color]\r\n[Color=Red]--------------------------------[/color]\r\nTo install with the Nexus Mod Manager, simply click download with manager, and when it has finished downloading double click on the mod in your mod list and let it override what it needs to.\r\n\r\n[Color=Red][size=4]---Uninstallation:---[/size][/color]\r\n[Color=Red]----------------------------------[/color]\r\n[Color=Red][size=3]Manual Uninstallation:[/size][/color]\r\n[Color=Red]-----------------------------------[/color]\r\nTo uninstall this mod via a Manual Uninstallation you must delete the .esp (ProperSkyrimVampires.esp) from your Skyrim/Data folder, then delete all the included Scripts & Script Source(only required really to save space). Then replace the playervampirequest.pex &.psc with the backups that you made.\r\n(If you did not follow my advice and make a backup, you can download the scripts from the downloads part of my mod page)\r\n\r\n[Color=Red]----------------------------------[/color]\r\n[Color=Red][size=3]NMM Uninstallation:[/size][/color]\r\nSimply double click the mod in your mod list and you have unistalled this mod.\r\n[Color=Red]----------------------------------[/color]\r\n\r\n[Color=Red][size=4]Upgrade:[/size][/color]\r\n[Color=Red]---------------------[/color]\r\nIf you are doing a Manual Install / Upgrade, then copy the contents of the archive to your Skyrim/Data folder, overriding any existing files.\r\n\r\nIf you are using the NMM then it will ask you if you want to upgrade, just say yes when it asks.\r\n\r\n[Color=Red][size=4]Known issues and bugs:[/size][/color]\r\n[Color=Red]-----------------------------------[/color]\r\nSome people seem to have problems when it comes to feeding, It is likely that this is caused by other vampire mods conflicting. - This should be fixed with any new versions (including 3.4)\r\n\r\nSometimes the Moth Priest will not be able to become your thrall even when you feed on him. \r\n\r\nNight Powers makes your Health, Magicka and Stamina regenerate instantly after going down, lots of spells don\\'t decrease Magicka and sprinting does not decrease stamina. - Fixed as of 3.32.\r\n\r\nPotions of Blood do not decrease your vampire rank, and do not count as feeding. - This has been fixes as of 3.4\r\n\r\nSee FAQ for fixes / workarounds to the bugs that have not been fixed\r\n\r\n[Color=Red][size=4]Reporting Bugs and Issues[/size][/color]\r\n[Color=Red]--------------------------------------[/color]\r\nIf you are going to report a bug, you should follow these steps:\r\n1. Check the known bugs and issues list, to make sure your bug is not there\r\n2. Before you report the bug, disable all other mods and run the game with only this mod\r\n3. If you still encountered the bug then proceed to the next step, else it was not a problem with this mod\r\n4. Go into the discussions tab and click on the Bug topic\r\n5. Report your bug here, making sure to describe the bug in as much detail as you can, what you were doing, where it happened (if necessary) etc.\r\n\r\nIf your bug did not appear after you disabled the other mods, it is likely that a mod conflict has occured, see the section below on reporting mod conflicts / incompatibilities.\r\n\r\nPlease do not start a personal conversation with me straight away, if I require you to do so, I shall either start it myself, or request you do so.   \r\n\r\n[Color=Red][Size=4]FAQ[/size][/color]\r\n[Color=Red]----------------------------[/color]\r\n[b][color=Red]|1. Feeding does not work - no red animation, regression in vampire ranks etc.[/color][/b]\r\n[b][color=Red]----------------------------------------------------------[/color][/b]\r\n If this occurs download the feeding fix file and place it in your Skyrim/Data/Scripts folder and for safe measure place this mod low down in your Load Order. If this still does not fix it then you have a mod that is conflicting. (see below for finding incompatible mods)\r\n\r\n[b][color=Red]|2. I cannot make the moth priest my thrall[/color][/b]\r\n[b][color=Red]----------------------------------------------------------[/color][/b]\r\n To get around this bug, you must open up the console by pressing the ` button (to the left of the button 1) and type SetStage DLC1VQ03Vampire 47, this will progress the quest to just after you would have thralled the moth priest, and you may now continue your story line\r\n\r\n[Color=Red][size=4]Incompatabilities:[/size][/color]\r\n[Color=Red]-------------------------------[/color]\r\nThis mod WILL conflict with any other vampire overhaul - you will just have to pick one or the other.\r\nFor any other vampire mods that make small changes, this mod must be placed below it in the load order (NOTE - conflicts may still occur)\r\n\r\nList of Incompatible mods (there are likely to be more than in this list):\r\nBetter Vampires by Brehanin 5_4\r\nBelua Sanguinare Revistited by MofoMojo\r\nSanguinare Vampiris - A Vampire Overhaul by Dawei87\r\nVampire Overhaul by Sann\r\n\r\n[Color=Red][size=4]Reporting Incompatabilities[/size][/color]\r\n[Color=Red]--------------------------------------[/color]\r\nFollow these steps if you are sure you are experiencing mod Incompatibility (see reporting bugs and issues above)\r\n\r\nIf you are experiencing an incompatibility with other mods, then it would be helpful for me if you would report it so that I can warn others about it, or maybe create a workaround / fix it.\r\n\r\nBefore you report the conflict, I request that you find the mod that is conflicting, as I will not go through downloading and testing mods from a list of mods that you send me. \r\n\r\nTo find the mod that is conflicting, re-enable each mod one by one, trying out the game each time you enable one (should probably only need worry about vampire mods, so re-enable all other mods first and test it, if it does not appear then proceed only doing the vampire mods, else do all of them)\r\n\r\nOnce you find the mod/s that are conflicting with this one, you should then post the names of the mods (along with the Author of the mod) in the Incompatibilities discussion.\r\n\r\nAgain, please do not just send me a direct message with the mods that are conflicting, as I am likely to delete these to keep my space free.\r\n\r\n[color=Red][size=4]Future Plans:[/size][/color]\r\n[color=Red]--------------------------[/color]\r\nIf you have any idea\\'s that you would like to be implemented for future versions, then please comment in the Requests Discussion - Please keep in mind that I am trying to keep this lore-friendly though\r\n\r\n[Color=Red][size=4]Credits:[/size][/color]\r\n[Color=Red]---------------------[/color]\r\nThanks to MofoMojo who helped me with tracking when you are in sunlight, and when you are in shdae\r\n\r\n[Color=Red][size=4]Tools Used:[/size][/color]\r\n[Color=Red]------------------------[/color]\r\n[url=http://newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=40278]Pyròs: GuideLines[/url]\r\n[url=http://www.win-rar.com/]WinRar[/url]\r\nCreation Kit, Available on Steam\r\n\r\n[Color=Red][size=4]Legal and licensing:[/size][/color]\r\n[Color=Red]---------------------------------[/color]\r\nPlease ask for my permission before you go changing and uploading this mod\r\n\r\n[color=Red][size=4]My Other Mods[/size][/color]\r\n[color=Red]---------------------------------[/color]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20779]Crafting Soul Gems[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22851]Helgen Equipment Variation[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21796]Improved Dragonplate Armour[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22742]Skyforge Steel Weapons - Craftable[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23673]Improved Werewolves[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23941]Weapons of the Dohvakiin[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26042]Craftable Wolf Armour[/url]",
