(Skyrim Nexus location)\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23826]SkyrimGEMS[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nThis mod simply moves your characters quivers closer to their bodies so they are no longer floating in mid-air. I was sick of seeing my quivers floating off my back and decided to try to do something about it. It\\'s not perfect but it\\'s pretty darn good. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n[b][color=red]Edit:[/b][/color] v3 is out! Now with longer arrows!  I received many requests to make my mod compatible with \\\"Proper Length Arrows\\\". Unfortunately i wasn\\'t able to make our mods work together. I then scrapped the idea of a \\\"compatible\\\" version and decided to fully redo my quivers and arrows and at least have a version of my own that would offer a closer quiver [b]with[/b] longer arrows. Finally, after struggling with the goofy way arrows and quivers interact i was able to make it happen. I hope everyone likes them. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nI would like to extend a special thank you to Madcat221. Even though i didn\\'t use his actual mod for v3, i did get the inspiration to make longer arrows because of him. He is the originator and at least deserves the credit for the idea. Thank you, sir.\r\n\r\nI would also like to give a special thank you to pseudoBug. His simple yet brilliant [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6830]Vanilla Tweaks - Arrow pickup fix[/url] inspired me to learn just how he managed to do it and offer his fix for people who use my mod. He is the original guy who figured it out and i\\'m very happy that he unknowingly taught me how to make the fix myself. Please give him kudos and endorsements as well if you like my version of the fix because without pseudoBug it never would have happened. Thanks, again.\r\n\r\n[b][color=red]Edit 2:[/b][/color] [b][color=orange][size=5]Finally, we have a working installer that officially works with NMM and Wrye Bash![/b][/color][/size] And i have two awesome people to thank for that... They are [b][size=5][color=#00BFFF]@WilliamImm[/b][/size][/color] and [b][size=5][color=#00BFFF]@Schwinni[/b][/size][/color]. The two of them took the initiative and completed something i had neither the time nor patience to pull of and then they somehow mashed both installers together into one big ball of installation greatness. So everyone that appreciates the NMM/BASH installer really need to send these guys some Kudos because without them the installer probably would have never been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=red][b][size=5]A Note About Custom Player Skeletons and Custom Body Replacers[/color][/b][/size]\r\n\r\nIf you use a custom player skeleton i cannot guarantee proper weapon placement. Some custom skeletons slightly (or more significantly) change weapon node positions and that can drastically alter where weapons sit on the body. This is why i had to make separate UNP compatible files, UNP uses a custom skeleton. So be warned.... \r\n\r\nAs far as custom body replacers go, It\\'s not a huge worry but there are a few body replacers that have larger butts or just generally have more \\\"enhanced\\\" features that could cause clipping in some cases. Especially if it has a bigger bottom to it. Most of the time this isn\\'t an issue but it can be.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=red][b][size=6]Installation:[/color][/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[color=red][b][size=6]NMM/BAIN Scripted Installer[/color][/b][/size]\r\nJust run the installer and choose the options you want or need.

Our two mods change the same source.\r\n\r\n\r\nBugs/Conflicts: Anything that changes the meshes for the various quivers.\r\n\r\nNotes: Some of the more form fitting armors may still contain small gaps. For instance Cicero\\'s clothing. There is still a gap but it is much smaller than vanilla. Also, Some of the larger armors that poke out around the spine and back also have a tendancy to have some clipping. Most of the main armors are perfectly fine but armors such as the stormcloak armor or emperor\\'s robes (since they are puffy) cover a majority of the quiver. A minor problem IMO.\r\n\r\nIf you like it please endorse!
