If I bite your head off, It&#39;s due to prego hormones and stress. So I am placing this as a courtesy.\r<br />\r<br />Love all users of the Matera (new and old)\r<br />Charis\r<br />[/heading] \r<br />For everyone that is having issues with showracemenu. [color=yellow]9/10[/color] times, it is not the mod. It is the showracemenu in general. Skyrim is designed to load everything at once while in character creation. So if you have say...hair mods. It will likely crash if your PC can not handle the output. So below is the recommended fix. Matera IS compatible with all hair mods. I have over 275+ hairs and I have yet to see any NOT compatible. \r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33526/?] ShowRaceMenu Precache Killer by kapaer[/url]\r<br />[line]\r<br />[center] I have placed a new requests section at the bottom of the page.

They love the steel in their hands and the armor against their fur. They are closer to the original Matera then any other of the orders. They much prefer strength over stealth and treat everyone in their order with due respect. They protect their family with fierce steel fangs and carry a warrior&#39;s heart.\r<br />[line]\r<br />[center][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23170/][IMG=left]http://i45.tinypic.com/2czep3d.png[/IMG][/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30673/][img]http://i49.tinypic.com/2lxgrvb.png[/img][/url][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center]Check out these other mods from Matera Users and Other Friends&#33;*Click on image to be relocated*[/center]\r<br />[center][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24407][IMG=center]http://i572.photobucket.com/albums/ss170/Ravenik/MateraRaceFollowers_zps83061755-1_zps666b77fd.jpg[/IMG][/url][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16712][IMG=center]http://i572.photobucket.com/albums/ss170/Ravenik/CustomSkeletonReplacers_zpsad36e447-1_zps8ad79fb8.jpg[/IMG][/url][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25331][IMG=center]http://i572.photobucket.com/albums/ss170/Ravenik/DovaStrunmahHoll_zps096d2335-1_zps2e847bfb.jpg[/IMG][/url][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30330][IMG=center]http://i50.tinypic.com/o94pw1.png[/IMG][/url][/center]\r<br />Disclaimer: All Images belong to their respective mod authors.

All you have to do is go to:\r<br />\r<br />Data-&gt;meshes(textures)-&gt;actor-&gt;character-&gt;rename Matera to BMatera-&gt; Overwrite in Skyrim installation.\r<br />\r<br />The only thing that won&#39;t change will be the warpaints.\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />[color=yellow][b]I want to replace your Battle Matera&#39;s Skeleton with another skeleton&#33; I don&#39;t like the default, it&#39;s no fun :/.[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Answer:Look Below Please-\r<br />\r<br />How To: Below is how to replace your Battle MaTera&#39;s skeletons to any other skeleton \r<br />\r<br />You have to copy the skeleton you are using from the default skeleton path\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][Your Install Location here]&#92;meshes&#92;actors&#92;character&#92;character assets female [for Female]\r<br />[Your Install Location here]&#92;meshes&#92;actors&#92;character&#92;character assets [for Male]\r<br />Copy skeletonbeast_female.nif [Female] OR skeletonbeast.nif [Male][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Paste in the MaTera location\r<br />[color=yellow][Your Install Location here]&#92;meshes&#92;actors&#92;character&#92;BMaTera&#92;female&#92;body [for Female]\r<br />[Your Install Location here]&#92;meshes&#92;actors&#92;character&#92;BMaTera&#92;male&#92;body [for Male][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=red]Make sure to use the BEAST skeleton of the skeleton variation you wish to replace. If not, it may crash because the Battle Matera NEED the tail nodes for it to work.[/color]\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />[color=yellow][b]Your Matera does not show up in the race menu&#33; What do I do?&#33;[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Answer: If it is not showing up it is a 95% probability that something was not downloaded/ installed at all or correctly. Something may also not be enabled(checked).\r<br />\r<br />First, make sure you have Race Compatibility by TMPheonix (NOT the older one&#33;). This IS required because the werewolf and the vampire won&#39;t work without it&#33;\r<br />Second, make sure that your Skyrim is updated to the latest version. As of writing this it is v1.8.1.\r<br />Third, Double check and MAKE sure the racecompatibility.esm AND Matera/BMatera is checked&#33; (I know, I know, noob mistake but it CAN HAPPEN)\r<br />Forth, Make sure you have the Main file installed THEN your body file (if done manually)(this won&#39;t usually cause it to not show up but its best to check)\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />[color=yellow][b]My Game crashes when changing from male to female or changing race in general.[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Answer: My first suggestion would be to check and make sure you have the correct body type (if you use an armor/clothing replacement) as well as the racial compatibility mod.\r<br />\r<br />[s]My HIGHEST suggestion would be to use the sex change work around mod below. I have not found anything not compatible with it yet.[/s]\r<br />\r<br />[s][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17071]Sex change crash Workaround by LABTECH[/url][/s] \r<br />\r<br />My NEW highest suggestion would be [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33526/?] ShowRaceMenu Precache Killer by kapaer[/url]\r<br />\r<br />The sex change still works but the pre-cache helps with alot more then just the sex.

It was the Brawl Bugs Patch itself. As soon as I uninstalled it, brawls began functioning correctly. If I had to guess, it&#39;s because I am using SPERG, which seems to have some sort of brawling fix already.\r<br />==============================================================================================================================\r<br />For the latest in preview images and announcements to upcoming patches and updates please click on the picture below:\r<br />[url=http://charismoon.tumblr.com/][img]http://i60.tinypic.com/2md0yuf.jpg[/img][/url]               ",
